Apple’s most recent 10-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission shows the company has budgeted **$11 billion in capital expenditures for fiscal 2014**.

This is more than **5 times** Apple's capital expenditure in 2010 and **57 percent more than the $7 billion it spent in 2013**.

What is Apple planning to do with all that additional money?

According to [Horace Dediu](http://www.asymco.com/2013/10/30/how-many-ios-devices-will-be-produced-in-the-next-12-months/) perhaps Apple is just conducting business as usual and the increased CAPEX simply reflects potentially higher sales volumes for iOS devices in 2014.  He has a chart that tracks capital expenditure against iOS device volume and they track very closely.  But I think the relationship may be somewhat coincidental.

Consider Apple's desire to move away from Samsung. Be it on displays or in chips, I suspect this strategic direction is increasing CAPEX significantly without any corresponding unit sale increases.

I also suspect the new campus has a significant impact. In addition we must consider the data centers Apple has been building over the last 2 years to support it's cloud services - clearly not production related CAPEX.

Logically a portion of 2014 CAPEX is going to new device development and production - the iPhone 6 will very likely have a new form-factor and design.  The iPod line needs a refesh.  But the iPad Mini and iPad Air in my opinion will remain as is in 2014.  So is the iPhone and iPod enough to drive CAPEX up that strongly?  I doubt it.

[Earlier this week, Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said the company is working on new releases in technology categories where it doesn’t yet compete.](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-30/apple-s-capital-spending-to-rise-to-11-billion-for-fiscal-2014.html)  So perhaps an iWatch or an iTV is what is driving this spend.  But maybe there is something really revolutionary coming.  Personally I want to be surprised and amazed in 2014 - just like when the original iPhone was introduced back in 20007.
