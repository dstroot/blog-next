Social media is overwhelming - we are inundated with email, text messages, tweets, facebook posts and who knows what else.  How to stay on top of it and share appropriately?

Feedly -> Buffer -> Everything (Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin)

## Weapons of Choice

[Feedly][1]. I love reading.  I love blogs.  But I can't visit all blogs, all the time.
* RSS was invented and it was glorious.
* Google Reader was created and the heavens shone with light.
* Reeder was built and my iPhone screamed with delight.  Now I can consume news all day, all night.
* Then Google killed Reader (and thus Reeder) and my life was shattered.
* Enter Feedly ... and the angels sing.

[Buffer][2]. "Easily add great articles, pictures and videos to your Buffer and we automagically share them for you through the day!"

[Hootsuite][3]. "The leading social media dashboard to manage and measure your social networks"
