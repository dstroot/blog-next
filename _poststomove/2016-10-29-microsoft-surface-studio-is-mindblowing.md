Saw the new Microsoft Surface Studio this weekend at the Microsoft store at the South Coast Plaza. I thought the display is pretty mind blowing. I have gotten used to wide screen displays but somehow the resolution and format of the screen just feels right. The display floats in space and fills your field of vision.

The surface dial seems like it would be a gimmick but it isn't. It feels very natural particularly when zooming in and out. Tilting the display down and working right on top of it is spectacular. Way to go Microsoft - you hit it out of the park!
