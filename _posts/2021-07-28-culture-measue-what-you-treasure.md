How do you actually measure culture? When determining how to measure culture note that culture is an **outcome**. If you could measure culture directly, you would be measuring a result - e.g. the current state (kind of like reading the speedometer in your car). Does simply knowing the current state help you improve it? Does knowing the speed of your car help you to speed up or slow down? Or, are those changes made through other means (e.g. the brakes and accelerator)?

You can measure employee burnout, or employee engagement, but those are **outcomes, not inputs** of your culture. They describe the current state.

I am suggesting you might have more success improving culture if you could measure and improve the "ingredients", "inputs", or "drivers" of a great culture (the gas and brakes), which in turn would lead to the cultural outcome you desire (the right speed).

Side Note: One of the values in my family was following the rules. So we had a defined bedtime as children, and we were expected to adhere to it. In my view my family just "followed the rules". My friends interpreted that as my parents being strict. Interestingly, **My friends had the exact same bedtime**, but their parents didn't enforce it. They had the same "rules" but a different cultural outcome. Another way to say this is one aspect of culture is not the slogan on the wall but rather how you allow people to behave. What you _actually_ allow vs. what you _say_ you allow. This is another way to view culture as an outcome.

When I think about what would create a culture that I would be proud to be part of I think of these "ingredients" or "inputs":

## Cultural Ingredients

### 1. Communication

With strong communication, employees are able to communicate their thoughts and suggestions to leadership, while leadership effectively communicates necessary information to employees.

Are our current channels of communication effective at helping everyone in the company send, receive and understand information?

**Possible metrics:**

- Ask employees to rate communication, how is it working top down, across the company and in your department?
- Number of Teams posts in Technology Team Channels

### 2. Innovation

Innovation is one of my favorite subjects. It is closely related to communication, because it comes down to whether employees:

1. Are really clear about what the company is trying to accomplish - the priorities and goals.
2. Have the ability to move ideas through the organization (and how much your company is open to new ideas).
3. Feel like innovating is just "part of job", it is expected and encouraged.

When measuring innovation, remember that it comes in many forms, such as resources, processes, behaviors and the product itself.

**Possible metrics:**

- Ask employees if they understand the goals of the organization?
- Do they feel like their ideas are heard and acted upon?
- Do they see others innovating?

### 3. Agility

Agility is key to staying competitive. How quickly can we respond to changes in the market? Do we we ever stop or cancel any projects in favor of new ones? If no programs/projects are ever deprioritized it's nearly impossible to be agile. Agility is also related to communications as changing views of the market and priorities need to be clearly communicated to employees along with "why".

**Possible metrics:**

- Ask employees to rate agility, what is slowing them down?
- Are priorities clear? How often do you perceive prioties changing?
- Number of projects deferred or canceled in favor of newer porjects/priorities?

### 4. Wellness

Wellness encompasses the mental and physical health of employees. Not only does wellness lead to happier and more productive employees but this metric also has an important ripple effect. According to [a study in Health Affairs](http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/29/2/304.full), medical costs and absentee costs fall about $3.27 and $2.73 respectively for every dollar spent on wellness programs.

**Possible metrics:**

- Ask employees to rate their perceived "wellness level"? (stress, exercise, work hours, etc.)
- Sick days, absence trends
- Employ the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) to measure employee state

### 5. Work Environment

You don’t need a trendy office to have an effective work environment. What is most important is that the workplace provides for comfortable, productive employees. For instance, small details, such as the temperature of the office, could be resulting in big losses in productivity. Focus on employee comments related to the workplace, and you will find some of the easiest and fastest ways to improve their performance.

Some office environments are noisy, lack privacy, or are simply to stimulating for deep thought. Employees may "self select" by working away from the office when they "just need to get something done". Pay attention because that may indicate issue with the environment.

**Possible metrics:**

- Ask employees... they'll tell you!
- Observe those employees that choose to work outside the office and ask why.

### 6. Collaboration

Collaboration has many layers, and once again, employee feedback is the key to getting to the bottom of them. To fully measure collaboration, look for collaboration within teams, as well as collaboration between teams.

**Possible metrics:**

- Ask employees?
- This is challenging to measure

### 7. Support

Employees should feel supported by the overall company, their manager and peers. According to a study in Harvard Business Review, [middle managers are the most disgruntled group in the workforce](https://hbr.org/2014/11/why-middle-managers-are-so-unhappy), possibly because they are lacking the support they need to be successful. By digging into this metric on an individual and group level, we can expose important trends in engagement.

**Possible metrics:**

- Ask employees?

### 8. Performance Focus

Everyone should understand what determines success in their role, and they should be rewarded or recognized accordingly. Larger rewards do not necessarily make for a stronger culture. Instead, take time to understand _if_ employees feel they are appreciated and _how_ they would like to be recognized.

**Possible metrics:**

- Ask employees to rate communication, how is it working top down, across the company and in your department?
- Number of Teams posts in Technology Team Channels

### 9. Responsibility

Responsibility encompasses employee accountability for actions and results, as well as the ability to make decisions regarding their work. While it seems like an individual metric, these behaviors should be promoted and assessed on a company-wide level. And believe me, you’ll find that employees are eager to report back on their experience in this area.

**Possible metrics:**

- Ask employees to rate communication, how is it working top down, across the company and in your department?
- Number of Teams posts in Technology Team Channels

### 10. Mission and Value Alignment

The first step is having a mission statement and company values, and that’s the easy part. You should also keep regular tabs on if employees _know_ your mission and values, _understand_ them, and _live_ by them. This process starts during recruitment, so don’t let this metric fall to the wayside during periods of high growth.

**Possible metrics:**

- Ask employees to rate communication, how is it working top down, across the company and in your department?
- Number of Teams posts in Technology Team Channels

## Culture Outcomes

If you get the ingredients right you should achieve the culture you desire. The results should be visible in the "outcome" metrics we are familiar with:

### Employee Engagement

What is employee engagement? Examples of employee engagement definitions include:

- Quantum Workplace - "Employee engagement is the strength of the mental and emotional connection employees feel toward their places of work."

- Gallup - "Engaged employees as those who are involved in, enthusiastic about and committed to their work and workplace."

- Willis Towers Watson – "Engagement is employees' willingness and ability to contribute to company success."

- Aon Hewitt - Employee engagement is "the level of an employee's psychological investment in their organization."

Behaviors of engaged and disengaged employees:

| **Engaged behaviors**                 | **Disengaged behaviors**              |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Optimistic                            | Pessimistic                           |
| Team-oriented                         | Self-centered                         |
| Goes above and beyond                 | High absenteeism                      |
| Solution-oriented                     | Negative attitude                     |
| Selfless                              | Egocentric                            |
| Shows a passion for learning          | Focuses on monetary worth             |
| Passes along credit but accepts blame | Accepts credit but passes along blame |

Six drivers of employee engagement that have the greatest impact:

1. The leaders of their organization are committed to making it a great place to work.
2. Trust in the leaders of the organization to set the right course.
3. Belief that the organization will be successful in the future.
4. Understanding of how I fit into the organization's future plans.
5. The leaders of the organization value people as their most important resource.
6. The organization makes investments to make employees more successful.

### Voluntary Turnover

Not every employee who is thinking about quitting will report so if asked. They may not answer honestly in employee engagement surveys about how satisfied they are with their work (especially if they’re concerned about getting fired for a negative review). Looking at voluntary employee turnover statistics can help uncover how effective company culture is at retaining employees—and avoid high employee attrition.

### Employee Burnout

The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) is the first scientifically developed measure of burnout and is used widely in research studies around the world. Since its first publication in 1981, it has been considered the gold standard. When used correctly, the applications of the MBI can greatly benefit employees.

Burnout is measured via a combination of dimensions: exhaustion, cynicism and professional efficacy. These measurements not only measure burnout but other outcomes/results as well:

- _Burnout:_ negative scores on exhaustion, cynicism, and professional efficacy
- _Overextended:_ strong negative score on exhaustion only
- _Ineffective:_ strong negative score on professional efficacy only
- _Disengaged:_ strong negative score on cynicism only
- _Engagement:_ strong positive scores on exhaustion, cynicism, and professional efficacy

Note the relationship of measuring employee burnout to employee engagement.

## Examples of effective programs

**JetBlue**

The airline employs a robust measurement program and tracks, among other metrics, employee satisfaction scores. According to Ann Rhoades, co-founder of JetBlue, former Chief People Officer of Southwest Airlines and Promus Hotel Company, “When an employee tells us they are very happy to be part of the organization, we calculate that number. It is a measure for all of our managers **and a portion of their bonus was based on the employee satisfaction score** in their department.”

Rhoades stressed that it’s important that every person is involved in meeting the metrics and goals. As an example, “The first day you come to work for us, we explain to you what the **main metrics are including cost per available seat mile and revenue per available seat mile.**”

JetBlue also actively uses a Net Promoter Score for employees. “When you get your six-month and 12-month employee satisfaction score, we ask you to tell us how long you intend to stay with us and would you recommend to family and friends to fly with and to work for JetBlue,” Rhoades said. “Those are critically important metrics for us.  It tells us whether our people are recruiting other A-players to work for us and whether they’re also telling their family that this is a great brand. If your own people aren’t promoting the company you have a serious problem.

**Zappos**

Well known for its commitment to culture, Zappos management places a high priority on the concept of connectedness to support its core values. To measure success in supporting this connectedness, the firm uses several tools including a Face game that, along with FaceMail, encourages employees to know each other and associate faces with names. Its effectiveness is regularly measured with an internal feedback system called Z60.
