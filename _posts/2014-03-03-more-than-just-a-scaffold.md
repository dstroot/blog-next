Yeoman example:

- Logical folder/file layout
- Bower setup and defaults
- Grunt setup and defaults - and it's a very built-out example!
- package.json setup and defaults
- TravisCI setup for continuous testing plus example test structure and tests
- .htaccess file for apache
- .jshintrc file for JSHint
- robots.txt
- css styles
- index.html page based on HTML5 Boiler Plate
- .gitignore file
- .gitattributes file
- .editorconfig file
- even a favicon.ico

Does this get you up and running? Absolutely!
Does it reflect current best practices? Absolutely!
Is it updated regularly? Absolutely!

But what is it really? It is basically **tooling**.

Tooling is good - if you are developer you should be **really, really into your tool stack.** That of course is what drives your productivity!

Paul Irish's Tooling Presentation:

But what happens when you want to go beyond tooling? When you just want a working basic site with authentication?
