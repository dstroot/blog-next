Bloomberg - the company - installed a framed New Yorker cartoon in every conference room in its New York headquarters that reads: “I know we didn’t accomplish anything, but that’s what meetings are for.”

Employees noted that there seems to be an endless drag of meetings, making it impossible to book a conference room in the building, which is headquartered on 60th Street and Lexington Avenue. Some surmised that Bloomberg — the man — had the cartoons placed in the conference rooms in order to “discourage pointless meetings.”

### Agreeing with Mr. Bloomberg

- **Meetings are often a waste of time**. There are often TOO many people invited, for TOO long of a time, covering TOO little content, with TOO little accountability.

- **Meetings are often disrespectful**. I have been to meetings where the presenter is “holding court”, essentially walking through their agenda, and essentially holding the audience hostage. Bad form, and disrespectful. You should have to have to earn the right to call a meeting. If you want to get input on an idea, project, proposal, or initiative then do the research, put together a persuasive view, walk the halls and talk to the right people, send out an email to get feedback, get buy-in, and start doing the work. Once it has momentum, get the right funding and resources in place and call the kick-off meeting.

- **Meetings are often poorly run**. Some people are better than others, but some meetings have no agenda, no facilitation, no sense of on-time start, on-time end, or meeting minutes. That is unacceptable. Time = money. “That is an hour of my life that I will never get back.”

- **Meetings are indiscriminate**. We all get invited to meetings once in a while when we wonder “why was I invited?” Some companies are quite hierarchical - they have to invite "all the bosses" to get something done. If you don't have a speaking or deciding role, you don’t need to be there. You can get the meeting minutes. Whenever I decide to NOT accept a meeting invite, and discover that the meeting was unproductive, I consider it a huge win. You **must make this OK** in your culture or people will be too polite to decline meetings.

- **Meetings are band-aids**. Too often, meetings are the only way things get done within a company. Without meetings, people don’t know what to do, how to do it, and are afraid to take action. It creates limited forward progress, and yet, they are needed because some progress is better than none. It is often a manual solution to a systemic problem. It does not solve the root cause of the problem.

- **Meetings reduce leverage**. People get stacked on top of each other, observing, commenting, and group-thinking answers. Have you been in meetings where there is a VP, Director, Manager, and Analyst from the same department. Hmm, not efficient.

- **Meetings are inevitable**. I am not so Pollyanna that I believe meetings can be abolished. In fact, it is how most organizations function. They use meetings to push things along, generate momentum, and gain consensus.

Ideally, organizations would have few meetings because people would know the organization / department / personal mission, collaborate daily, know where to find information and resources, innovate, make mistakes, and organically course-correct within a culture of trust and growth. Sadly, that is rare.
