title: Corporate Bullshit
excerpt:
  No longer is corporate bullshit a handy supply of manure for fertilizing
  new ideas and innovation. Corporate bullshit has a number of negative effects on
  both employees and organizations, including a separation of talk and action, an
  apparent ignorance to well-established assumptions and a tendency to suppress those
  with differing opinions and perspectives. The most detrimental consequence of rampant
  organizational bullshit is the corrosion of organizational decision-making.

The skill of spotting false information - rubbish, nonsense and, yes, fake news — is so important these days that scientists have begun serious research on it. They’re attempting to quantify when and why people spread it, who is susceptible to it, and how people can confront it.

Most people are rather confident of their ability to recognize bullshit. However, we have may not have a crisp definition of what bullshit is, why there is so much of it, or what functions it serves.

B.S. is a form of persuasion that aims to impress the listener, while employing a lower priority for the truth. This definition is presented by the philosopher and Princeton emeritus professor Harry Frankfurt in his now-classic 2005 book [“On Bullshit.”](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691122946/on-bullshit)

Liars at least acknowledge that it matters what is true. By virtue of this, Frankfurt writes, bullshit is a greater enemy of the truth than lies are.

### Bullshit in the Workplace

Organizational bullshit can have a positive effect when leaders communicate a fuzzy but inspiring future. This is generally known as a handy supply of manure for fertilizing new ideas and innovation.

However, much of the time there are serious detrimental effects of bullshit:

- Lower job satisfaction,
- Increased distrust in leadership,
- Reduction in productivity, and
- A negative impact on overall performance

Corporate bullshit has a number of negative effects on both employees and organizations, including a separation of talk and action, an apparent ignorance to well-established assumptions and a tendency to suppress those with differing opinions and perspectives. The most detrimental consequence of rampant organizational bullshit is the corrosion of organizational decision-making.

### Definition of Workplace Bullshit

In order to discuss the impacts of bullshit in the workplace we need a clear definition and a means of measuring it.

Recent reseach created the **Organizational Bullshit Perception Scale (OBPS)**. The scale is designed to gauge perceptions of the extent of organizational bullshit that exists in a workplace. Research revealed three key factors of organizational bullshit:

1. Regard for truth,
2. "The boss", and
3. Bullshit language

#### 1. Regard for Truth

The first factor is based on the fundamental act of bullshit: communicating with little to no regard for truth, related evidence, and established knowledge. This disconnection from the truth seems to be stronger - more pervasive and more accepted - in some organizations than others. This variation is likely to be reflected in the extent to which an organization has a culture of **seeking and using evidence to support statements**, as opposed to it being more commonplace for employees and leaders to rely on hunches, anecdotes and personal experiences and opinions when making decisions or persuading others to their points of view.

In other words, this dimension of bullshit reflects the degree to which an organization tolerates (or even embraces) individuals who make statements with no regard for the truth. Does the organization accept, ignore, or challenge bullshit statements that try to impress or persuade (i.e., persuasive bullshitting), or to avoid, dodge or elude something (i.e., evasive bullshitting)?

We must measure the extent to which **employees believe their organization has a culture that expects workplace statements and discussions should have a regard for truth that is grounded in evidence and established knowledge.**

#### 2. "The Boss"

The second factor concerns the communication behavior of high-status individuals in organizations. Since leaders are likely to be the most important and influential bullshitters in organizations, we must measure subordinates’ perceptions of whether their bosses tend to engage in bullshit-related practices.

Leaders will be driven to bullshit when the social and professional expectations to have an opinion are high, and when they expect to get away with it. These two conditions are subject to how (un)knowledgeable their audience is.

Similarly, if leaders exhibit high levels of overconfidence, and believe they are popular amongst their peers, this will make them likely to engage in more bullshit-related behavior.

#### 3. Bullshit Language

Bullshit typically contains language that is meant to enhance the credibility of arguments or statements, and to bolster the legitimacy of a bullshitter, while at the same time trying to befuddle listeners so they are unable or unwilling to try to penetrate to the lack of truth behind the bullshit.

Corporate jargon is one example of organizational bullshit language, whereby words or expressions are used in an attempt to legitimize something, whilst at the same time confusing language and thinking. We all know a number of corporate bullshit expressions when we hear them such as “out-of-the-box thinking”, which are often used as buzzwords with minimal substance.

Corporate speak is often littered with TLAs (three letter acronyms), and many names that essentially mean the same thing but indicate status and inside knowledge. A new prooduct for example may have a code name, a project name to launch it, and a external name for public use. Which name is used internally can project either status (for those in know), or bullshit.

This vagueness serves the interests of bullshitters, because communication targets are less likely to ask questions, or challenge, when they find it difficult to understand what has been said. Bullshit language therefore goes beyond what is said, but also incorporates **how it is said** – whereby both components are able to compound the actions of bullshitters.

_**Side Note**: I bullshit you not, "Trumpery" is a real word. According to the Merriam Webster dictionary [Trumpery](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/trumpery) derives from the Middle English trompery and ultimately from the Middle French tromper, meaning "to deceive." (You can see the meaning of this root reflected in the French phrase "trompe-l'oeil", literally, "deceives the eye"). Trumpery first appeared in English in the mid-15th century with the meanings "deceit or fraud" and "worthless nonsense."_

### Responses to Bullshit

In the workplace there are four responses from individuals that work to promote or hinder the prevalence of organizational bullshit:

- Exit (they try to escape the bullshit),
- Challenge (they confront the bullshit),
- Loyalty (they embrace and spread the bullshit), or
- Neglect (they simply disengage from the bullshit)

> “One of the most salient features of our culture is that there is so much bullshit. Everyone knows this. Each of us contributes his share. But we tend to take the situation for granted.”
