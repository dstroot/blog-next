title: Corporate Bullshit
excerpt: Corporate bullshit can be a handy supply of manure for fertilizing
  new ideas and innovation. Corporate bullshit also has a number of negative effects on
  both employees and organizations, including a separation of talk and action, an
  apparent ignorance to well-established assumptions, and a tendency to suppress those
  with differing opinions and perspectives. The most detrimental consequence of rampant
  organizational bullshit is the corrosion of organizational decision-making.

The skill of spotting false information - rubbish, nonsense and, yes, fake news — is so important these days that scientists have begun serious research on it. They’re attempting to quantify when and why people spread it, who is susceptible to it, and how people can confront it.

Most people are rather confident of their ability to recognize bullshit. However, we have may not have a crisp definition of what bullshit is, why there is so much of it, or what functions it serves.

According to the philosopher and Princeton emeritus professor Harry Frankfurt in his now-classic 2005 book [“On Bullshit”](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691122946/on-bullshit), liars at least acknowledge that it matters what is true. By virtue of this, Frankfurt writes, **bullshit is a greater enemy of the truth than lies** are.

### Bullshit in the Workplace

Organizational bullshit can have a positive effect when leaders communicate a fuzzy but inspiring future. This is generally known as a handy supply of manure for fertilizing new ideas and innovation.

However, there can be serious detrimental effects of bullshit:

- Lower job satisfaction,
- Distrust in leadership,
- Reduction in productivity (slower to make decisions), and
- Poorer quality decisions

Corporate bullshit has a number of negative effects on both employees and organizations, including a tendency to suppress those with differing opinions and perspectives. The most detrimental consequence of rampant organizational bullshit is the **corrosion of organizational decision-making**.

### Defining Workplace Bullshit

Recent reseach created the **Organizational Bullshit Perception Scale (OBPS)**. The scale is designed to gauge perceptions of the extent of organizational bullshit that exists in a workplace. The research revealed three key factors of organizational bullshit:

1. Regard for truth,
2. "The boss", and
3. Bullshit language

#### F1. Regard for Truth

The tolerance for bullshit seems to be stronger - more pervasive and more accepted - in some organizations than others. This variation is likely to be reflected in the extent to which an organization has a culture of **seeking and using evidence to support statements**, as opposed to it being more commonplace for employees and leaders to rely on hunches, anecdotes, and personal experiences and opinions when making decisions or persuading others to their points of view.

This factor of bullshit reflects the degree to which an organization tolerates (or even embraces) individuals who make statements with no regard for the truth. Does the organization accept, ignore, or challenge bullshit statements that try to impress or persuade (i.e., persuasive bullshitting), or to avoid, dodge or elude something (i.e., evasive bullshitting)?

We must measure the extent to which employees believe their organization has a culture that expects workplace statements and discussions **to have a regard for truth**, and be grounded in evidence and established knowledge.

Employees are exceptionally tuned to recognize bullshit and this is a source of frustration for many of them. While an organizational disregard for the truth may be accepted under certain circumstances, such disregard may lead to organizations making more questionable decisions that could alienate employees, and could ultimately put their jobs at risk by endangering the welfare of their companies.

#### F2. "The Boss"

The second factor concerns the communication behavior of high-status individuals in organizations. Since leaders are the most important and influential bullshitters in organizations, we should measure subordinates’ perceptions of whether their bosses tend to engage in bullshit-related practices.

Leaders will be driven to bullshit when the social and professional expectations to have an opinion are high, and when they expect to get away with it. These two conditions are subject to how (un)knowledgeable their audience is.

Similarly, if leaders exhibit high levels of overconfidence, and believe they are popular amongst their peers, this will make them likely to engage in more bullshit-related behavior.

Employees believe that their superiors are key players in the dissemination of corporate bullshit. Further, employees are likely to have to take action based on any bullshit communicated by their bosses. As a result, employees are acutely aware when their superiors use bullshit to advance their own self-interests.

#### F3. Bullshit Language

Bullshit typically contains language that is meant to enhance the credibility of a bullshitter, while at the same time trying to befuddle others so they are unable or unwilling to try to penetrate to the lack of truth behind the bullshit.

Corporate jargon is one example of organizational bullshit language, whereby words or expressions are used in an attempt to legitimize something, whilst at the same time using confusing language and thinking. We all know a number of corporate bullshit expressions when we hear them such as “thinking outside the box”, “low hanging fruit”, or “drink the kool aid”.

Corporate speak is littered with TLAs (three letter acronyms), and many names for things that essentially mean the same thing but indicate status and inside knowledge. A new product for example may have a code name, a project name to launch it, and a external name for public use. Which name is used internally can project either status (for those in know), or bullshit.

Employees who are bullshit targets are less likely to ask questions, or challenge, when they find it difficult to understand what has been said. Bullshit language therefore goes beyond what is said, but also incorporates **how it is said** – both components compound the actions of bullshitters.

Employees know that the excessive use of such language is a form of bullshit - they are not oblivious to its use in the workplace. They sense if a statement is riddled with meaningless language, acronyms, buzzwords, and jargon, then it is very likely to be bullshit.

_**Side Note**: I bullshit you not, "Trumpery" is a real word. According to the Merriam Webster dictionary [Trumpery](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/trumpery) derives from the Middle English trompery and ultimately from the Middle French tromper, meaning "to deceive." (You can see the meaning of this root reflected in the French phrase "trompe-l'oeil", literally, "deceives the eye"). Trumpery first appeared in English in the mid-15th century with the meanings "deceit or fraud" and "worthless nonsense."_

### Responding to Corporate Bullshit

Employees are attuned to the presence of bullshit in organizations, and their attitudes, beliefs, and actions are likely to be influenced by their perceptions of it.

In the workplace there are four responses from individuals that work to promote or hinder the prevalence of organizational bullshit:

- **Exit/disengage** (they try to escape the bullshit, or they simply disengage from the bullshit),
- **Challenge** (they confront the bullshit), or
- **Loyalty** (they embrace and spread the bullshit)

The OBPS provides a simple checklist for human resource practitioners to use to diagnose both the actual prevalence of organizational bullshit, as well as the extent to which employees believe it is present in an organization. The tool also enables the identification of more specific areas in which bullshit might be a cause of problems so that these can then be addressed:

- Does communication in the organization occur without regard for evidence?
- Do senior executives purvey bullshit in their communication?
- Is there excessive use of acronyms (e.g. CPC, LBH, NBD) and jargon?

If these conditions are be identified, strategies can be developed and employed for remedying them!
