If you watch someone run the 100 meters, they sneak glances around. Sprinters watch each other while they run.  They want to know where are in the pack.  I noticed that only Usain Bolt looks at the clock. Why?

Usain Bolt looks at the clock because heâ€™s used to being ahead of everyone else.  I think it is _because he is really only competing against himself_.

When trying to introduce innovation I often get asked a frustrating question. The question is "Who else is doing/using this?" or "How does Blackrock / PIMCO / Janus / Etc. do it?".  It is even worse when talking about policy because I am almost guaranteed to hear: "What's Goldman's / Barclay's / Fidelity's policy?"

It seems in order to make a decision some people want to know what everyone else is doing first.  This line of questioning is almost inevitable in a large organization but it makes me cringe when I hear it.

Think about it for a moment. This isn't the recipe for leadership and innovation.  This is the recipe for risk avoidance/going with the heard.  It is the sprinters in the pack looking around to see where everyone else is.

> **PROTIP:**
> You can't define your metrics in terms of others. In other words
> "We want to be in the top quartile" means you are just in the pack
> watching everyone else. Define your goals simply, directly, and on
> your own terms: "Our margin will be 20%" or "We will bring in
> $1 Billion in net flows" and then watch **your** scoreboard.

If you really want to lead then you should only look at your target, the clock, your scoreboard because **everyone else is behind you.**
