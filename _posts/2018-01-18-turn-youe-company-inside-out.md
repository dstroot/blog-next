I have already described the "inside out" corporation [here](https://danstroot.com/2017/04/10/the-inside-out-corporation/). 

It imagines a world where:

* Corporate networks no longer exist (so VPNs and other remote access solutions are no longer needed)
* There is no concept of "in" or "outside" the corporate network.
* All corporate services are accessible anywhere over the Internet **securely**.
* Corporate network costs are reduced appropriately.

This idea was first evangelized by Google (who know a thing or two about infrastructure and security) and they called it "BeyondCorp".  This month Cloudflare introduced [Cloudflare Access](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cloudflare-access/) to do make the technology Google uses accessible to all enterprises.  It’s like BeyondCorp, but you don’t have to be a Google employee to use it. The best part is that it is just $3/mo per seat.  

As a CIO I **love this concept** of lowering enterprise costs, simplifying employee access to corporate services, and increasing security. It's a win-win-win.
