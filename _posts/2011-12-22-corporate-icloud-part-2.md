When Apple introduced iCloud I wrote an article about the potential impact in the corporate computing space: [The Corporate iCloud](http://danstroot.com/2011/06/10/corporate-icloud/).

In the article I compared what I was doing with Dropbox as a potential corporate version of iCloud.  It turns out there was a LOT more there than meets the eye.  Dropbox may even have **become** iCloud had some things gone a bit differently.

Wired has done a [deep dive](http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/12/backdrop-dropbox) on this topic.  It's a great read.
