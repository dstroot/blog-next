The way I learned coding is the opposite of how we teach coding

The way code is taught is either aligned to how computers work (why variables are 16, 32 or 64 bits, how the machine stores them) or language constructs and syntax, like this:

* Chapter 1: Types
* Chapter 2: Variables
* Chapter 3: Operators/Math
* Chapter 4: Control structures
* Chapter 5: Arrays
* Chapter 6: Functions
* Chapter 7: Structs
* Chapter 8: Classes and Objects
* Chapter 9: Methods
* Chapter 10: Inheritance and Polymorphism
* Chapter 11: Some advanced thing X
* Chapter 12: Some esoteric thing Y
* Chapter 13: You think you are so smart so let's introduce concurrency

The way I learned to code is by building things!  

I want to create a website, or an API, or a program that reads twitter tweets and calculates sentiment, you get the picture – I want to make something.  To make it I need skills! The motivation to learn the skills comes from the desire to make something, not simply to possess the skills to be able to make something.

Once I have an idea of something I want to make, I tend to ask myself what the best technologies might be to implement the idea. That also involves asking other people smarter than I am. As an example, for a high-performance API I might choose Go or Rust.  

If I don’t already know the language, I will setup a development environment, get the reference material (e.g., “The Go programming Language” by Donovan and Kernigan) and begin.  I will read enough to get myself started, I will seek examples of good code on GitHub, I will watch YouTube videos, and if I get stuck, I go back to the reference material.  Rarely, if ever, will I read a code language book cover to cover – I tend to use it as reference material only.  

The main point is humans learn a) when they are motivated and want to learn, and b) most of us learn by doing.  This is one of the main reasons I like forms of “group” programming – pair, or mob programming.  

## Summary

If you want to reduce technology risk you must be able to measure and reason about the factors that actually drive your largest, critical technology risks. This is a good starting point to think about technology risks that may fall outside of control frameworks. Is your internal technology risk management function measuring these factors?

Dennis Ritchie is sitting at the console at Bell Labs in 1972. He created the C programming language and, with colleague Ken Thompson (who is looking over his shoulder), the Unix operating system. Ritchie and Thompson were awarded the Turing Award from the ACM in 1983, the Hamming Medal from the IEEE in 1990 and the National Medal of Technology from President Bill Clinton in 1999. Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernigan wrote the book "The C Programming Language" - my first programming language book.
