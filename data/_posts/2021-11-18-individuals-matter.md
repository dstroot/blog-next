One of the worst cognitive biases which humans suffer from is the belief that observations about individuals can be generalized. How much faulty thinking, including racism and sexism, stems from this simple error? An extension of this common mistake is thinking of people as interchangeable, or fungible, when planning work - as if “who” does the work doesn’t matter.

_Individuals matter._

A pattern I've repeatedly seen is companies will plan out the next few quarters of work and then assign some number of people to it, one person for one quarter to a project, two people for three quarters to another, etc. This process enables executives to make decisions about costs, priorities and project funding, and teams to understand what other teams are doing and plan appropriately. However, I've never worked in an organization where this level of planning enabled teams to effectively execute work.

The roadmap creation and review process perpetuates the polite fiction that people are interchangeable, that people can be generically abstracted over. However, when the rubber meets the road, and a critical project simply must be completed on time what happens? Suddenly the people who are assigned to the project become very, very important.

When work starts on a specific project, the first questions asked are "**Who** is going to lead it? **Who** is going work on it?". We all know intuitively that the people who ultimately get staffed on the project make an enormous difference on how long it will take, and the odds of success.

One of the primary jobs of managers at all levels is to plan and then execute in accordance with the plan. Some managers are good at it, many aren’t, but the good ones know which people get stuff done and how long something should take. Good managers can even adjust estimates based on individual productivity. Only a direct line manager can do this, anyone else won’t have the knowledge of each person’s capabilities.

This is how you build highly accurate plans – you must plan with the specific people in mind who will be doing the work.

### An Early Lesson Why Individuals Matter

A senior engineer had built a rather complicated system and was intimately familiar with all aspects of it. Whenever he estimated work for that system, he estimated it as if he were doing the work. In other words, how long would it take **him** to program “X feature”? His estimates came with all the discovery work already done, and they were **extremely** accurate.

One day a project manager proceeded to take an estimate from this person and assign it to a brand-new hire. When it was almost due, the brand-new engineer said something like "It's not done yet. I'm not sure how long it will take, but I am learning a ton of cool stuff!" Needless to say, it could have gone better for me.

Later, when I was asked to estimate work the first question I would ask was “who is going to do it?”. Project managers were taken aback by the question, and often told me “It doesn’t matter”, as if we are all supposed to pretend that all resources are equal.

Imagine if you wrote a novel and then decided you wanted your friend to write the final chapter, how long would it take them? How well would it turn out? They’d have to learn the book first, right? Or maybe you’d give them an outline as a starting point? Even if they were brilliant they are likely to take longer than you. Not that much different from programming.

One of the more successful organizations I have had the pleasure of leading had a completely different approach - every estimate explicitly assumed a specific person handles it. Sometimes there were even variations given – e.g., several estimates for the same task depending on who it gets assigned to. No one ever found this odd. It was assumed it was just obvious that different people have different skills and familiarity with different technologies or parts of the project.

Individuals matter.

### Job Complexity Matters

If I have a job that only requires picking up rocks and placing them in a bucket, one could argue that “anyone could do it”, which is generally true. However even with unskilled labor there are considerable differences in output. How strong am I? How much stamina do I have? Do I have good eyesight to see rocks from far away? Do I pick up “good” rocks? Even in this absurd example individual performance matters.

As we progress from “lifts rocks” to “performs brain surgery” the capability, knowledge, and skill of the specific individual matters more and more. None of us would choose a doctor by random selection using the mental model that they are “all the same”. My mental model is 50% of doctors graduated at the bottom half of their class.

Technology jobs have progressed much like medicine – as technology has become more and more complex, jobs have become increasingly specialized. Increasing specialization, coupled with business knowledge tends to make individuals highly specialized (and really matter to your company).

The more complexity there is in your business, and the more unique your business is, the more individuals matter.

### The Type of Work Matters Too

Motivation is a big one. Some tasks (or projects) just don't motivate me at all, and they turn into an awful slog. Others are enthralling and I have a hard time logging out at the end of the day. I think there's easily a 5x difference in my own personal performance between those. Could be more.  What is your productivity difference when you work on something you are excited about and believe in vs. something you think is a waste of your time?

In addition to motivation is skills alignment – this leads to the concept of the “10x” engineer – the rock star who is ten times as productive as the average engineer. Whether you believe in this idea or not, we probably can agree that some people are significantly more productive - and hiring for that trait is nearly impossible.

Why? Because they are only productive _after_ they learn your systems, technology, business practices. In other words, _no one comes in the door as a 10x engineer_. On the other hand, you can develop people into 10x engineers. This suggests that taking steps to _retain_ highly effective engineers (and highly effective teams) by not ignoring the evidence that they are not fungible is what is most important.

The other factor is engineers are usually only “10x” in narrow, specialized technology areas that they know well. If you move them to another team, using different technology and supporting a different business process they quickly revert to being average (at least until they come up to speed again, which may or may not happen). In other words, if we asked Lebron James to play soccer (play with his feet and not his hands) he might be far below average – and remain there.

If the work matters then matching the right individual to the right work matters.

### Our Bias Complements our Desire for Simplicity

When you have a complex system, for example a company with thousands of people, the system is too complex for any decision maker to really understand. Organizations are like fractals – the more you zoom in the more complexity you perceive/see.

One way to address this problem is by reducing the perceived complexity of the problem by simplifying the picture of the organization by creating organizational structure - groupings of people. For example, “business units”, “departments”, “subsidiaries”, “divisions”, etc. and imagining that people inside are fungible.

Unlike trying to understand the true complexity of the organization this structure is easier to grasp, it's scalable, and if there's one thing that companies like, it's doing things that scale. Large organizations also scale by tracking and managing “headcount” - and one of the ways to view people as fungible is budgeting in terms of headcount. The company, of course, spends money on specific people with specific skills, and not "heads", but internal bookkeeping is done in terms of "heads", so $X of budget will be, for some specific team, translated into "three staff-level heads".

There's no way to convert that into "two more effective and better-paid heads" because that isn’t a scalable model. If you hire two rock-star staff engineers and not a third, the third "head", and the associated budget, will eventually get moved somewhere else.

The other main reason is organizations must be able to plan. Every team I have ever worked with hates planning; every team hates their methodology and thinks it’s senseless and inaccurate and why are those senior people insisting on a date; it’ll be done when it’s done.

On the other hand, business leaders often must plan around dates – e.g. “should we spend $50k announcing at conference Y next month, or should we wait?” “Our competition just launched; will we be able to launch this quarter (the board wants to know, and we have to report material financial impact items quarterly or face SEC fines)?”

Planning is absolutely necessary and as noted earlier, one of the primary jobs of managers at all levels is to plan and then execute in accordance with the plan. The higher in the organization the manager the more abstracted “the plan” becomes from the people who actually accomplish the work – in fact it is often abstracted to stoplight colors: green, yellow, red. However, it’s the individuals doing the work that matter; who determine if something is green, yellow or red.

Individuals matter.
