title: Values or Beliefs?
excerpt: 'Most company values are just a bunch of undifferentiated "nice things". Which company wouldn’t say they are about honesty, teamwork, or passion? The problem is employees can’t easily turn those words into actions. They don’t tell us how to "walk the tightrope" and balance our decisions. Why not?'

Every company has "core values". They are almost always some combination of these ten:

<span className="text-base">
1.  **Integrity.** 
2.  **Honesty.** 
3.  **Fairness.** 
5.  **Accountability.** 
6.  **Promise to Customers.** 
7.  **Diversity and Inclusion.** 
8.  **Learning.** 
9.  **Teamwork.** 
10.  **Passion.**
11.  **Quality.**
</span>

If we’re aligned on a set of values, then we can trust each other to make decisions that "fit" our culture and values. They help us hire colleagues who are aligned to our values. That helps us move fast. Values boost morale.

_Right?_

Not so fast. These values are too generic.  They don't specify exactly what we mean, or how we want our or employees to act.  They don't tell us what the company stands for, or believes in. They don't tell us how to make tradeoffs. They don't tell us how to "walk the tightrope" and balance our decisions.

## Good: Values Must be Verbs

Most company values are just a bunch of undifferentiated _nice things_. Which company _wouldn’t_ say they want to focus on honesty, teamwork, or passion? However, the words are not actionable. They don't guide employee behavior or decisions.  

Are your company's values successful in making it easy to make decisions? Do _you_ use them when making decisions? Do you even remember your company’s values?

The first thing we need to do to make them actionable and real is to translate them into verbs.  

>"For values or guiding principles to be truly effective they have to be verbs. It’s not “integrity,” it’s “always do the right thing.” It’s not “innovation,” it’s “look at the problem from a different angle.” Articulating our values as verbs gives us a clear idea . . . we have a clear idea of how to act in any situation. We can hold each other accountable to measure them or even build incentives around them. Telling people to have integrity doesn’t guarantee that their decisions will always keep customers’ or clients’ best interests in mind; telling them to always do the right thing does."

### Examples

* Instead of **courage** say: “_We question actions inconsistent with our values._”
* Instead **integrity** say: “_We only say things about fellow employees directly to them._”
* Instead of **openess** say: "_We say what we think, even if it is uncomfortable._"

This is a great start - it is starting to bring to life what living our values looks like. However we can do even better.  We often naturally think of choices in terms of "yes or no". Do I want to go out for dinner tonight?  The real choice is "**where** do I want to go for dinner?"  

Whatever I choose it means I have **not** chosen other good options. Decisions are really about making tradeoffs.  

## Better: Values Must Specify Tradeoffs

Our time and resources are finite - saying "yes" to something is implicitly a "no" to other possible options. It's very hard to make choices when it requires you to discriminate among many good options. It's even worse because your values can make your employees feel trapped - that they must somehow be "fast", "cheap", **and** "perfect".

For values to be truly useful they must specify the tradeoffs we should make.  Nearly every decision we are asked to make every single day involves deciding what is most important to us and where we must compromise. Deciding what law firm to hire, college to attend, car to buy, company to work for, candidate to elect—ultimately comes down to "even/over" decisions. Making these hard choices ultimately yields one consistent result: stress. 

What can we tell our employees about our values that actually helps them make decisions and removes stress?  The most well-known example is Facebook's motto: 

>"Move fast _and break things_." 

It’s not just “move fast”. Who doesn’t want to move fast? How does that aid decision making? Instead, it's "move fast _and break things_".  

Why give explicit permission to break things? Engineers at large internet organizations who are responsible for operating an organization's web presence are amazingly talented and they also abhor change.  In order to keep operational stability they view making changes like most of us view juggling chain saws - fun to watch someone else do it, but when it goes wrong it goes **really** wrong. 

This value communicates perfectly that Facebook valued speed **even/over** stability and quality.  It was meant to tell the engineers it was OK if the systems had some instability if that meant speed of delivery was improved.  **That is a clear value that allows for autonomous decisions - exactly what we want.**

Nordstrom is another great example.  They state what they are about right in their mission statement:

>"Our mission is to continue our dedication to providing a unique range of products, **exceptional customer service, and great experiences.**”

If I have to state a value for Nordstrom it might be "We take care of our customers, even/over taking care of our ourselves."  I used to exclusively shop at Nordstrom's because I had the sense that if I ever had any problems **they would be resolved in my favor.**

Finally, let's take one more example from Netflix:

>"We’re a team, not a family; We’re like a pro sports team, not a kid’s recreational team."
	
A friend said "I'd never want to work for Netflix after reading that." Another friend said "that's great that they are so honest and upfront". This is a signal that Netflix  phrased their values well. A good values statement should polarize. It should attract the right people and repel people who's core value don't align.  

Remember, if we tell our employees we value "quality _and_ speed" it's pointless.  It's going to get a well deserved eye-roll.  However, if we tell our employees we value "quality even/over speed" now we have provided clear guidance about our values and enabled our employees to make appropriate choices. We will also attract the right people who value quality.  

### Example

Let's assume our company has a value called "Fairness". First, let's make our value a verb. Instead of just "fairness" how about: 

>"Always treat our customers and our employees equally and fairly."

Good.  But we can do much better - let's specify the tradeoffs we expect:

>"Always treat our customers and employees equally and fairly, even if that means we cannot satisfy some of our most demanding customers."

Our value is now clear. It will serve as a guide for our culture and enable our employees to operate independently and make decisions aligned with our concept of fairness. 

## Best: Values Specify Beliefs

I believe a company should not have core values. Instead, I believe "core beliefs" are better and far more powerful. 

Martin Luther King inspired change in a country where many people didn't want to change. In his famous speech he told us his core beliefs and where they could take us. He said "I believe..." and "I have a dream.."  If your beliefs aligned with his you felt inspired. His dreams became your dreams, and shared beliefs were the "fuel" that inspired us to act. 

Core beliefs begin with "I believe" or "We believe". Let's re-craft Facebook's "move fast and break things" as a belief:

>"We believe we are the most powerful social media platform on earth. However, our competitors have access to the same technology and talent that we do, and they move quickly. As we grow we must keep our ability to move fast to continue to lead our industry. So, move fast and break things!"

How about Netflix:

>"We believe business is a contact sport. There are winners and losers. Only the winners reap the rewards and we believe in winning. So we compete hard. We’re a team, not a family; We’re like a pro sports team, not a kid’s recreational team.  We are laser-focused on winning."

Get the idea?  See how powerful beliefs can be?

### Background

The words "incision" and "decision" have the same latin root; the verb **incīdere**, meaning “to carve” or “to cut into.”  So, a decision is when you “cut away” the other options and commit to the one you’ve left intact.

In logic and philosophy, a **razor** is a rule of thumb that you can use to “cut” weaker lines of reasoning — which can help you to make wiser judgments and cleaner decisions, quickly.

Most of us have heard of Occam's razor:

>When confronted with equally plausible lines of reasoning, favor the one which makes fewer assumptions.

The concept in decision-making of a "razor" is a principle or guideline that is worded specifically enough to clearly slice up a set of options into whether they fit or not. In your company your beliefs and values must be the "razors" that guide all your decisions.
