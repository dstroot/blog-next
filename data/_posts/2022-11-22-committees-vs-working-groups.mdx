title: Committees vs. Working Groups
excerpt: "Engineering teams love full rewrites because they incorrectly think of old systems as specs. They assume that since the old system works, all functional aspects have been settled. Design risks have been eliminated! They can focus purely on the technical side, add more features to the new system, or make changes to the underlying architecture without worry. However, the belief that new code is better than old is patently absurd. Old code has been used. It has been tested. Lots of bugs have been found, and more importantly fixed. So what path to take?"

What are the differences between a working group and a committee? What is the correct way to apply these concepts to "getting things done"?

>"A camel is a horse, but designed by committee."

_Committees of twenty<br/>Deliberate plenty;<br/>Committees of ten<br/>Act now and then;<br/>But most jobs are done<br/>By committees of one._

Working groups relax hierarchy to allow people to solve problems across organizational units, whereas committees both reflect and reinforce those organizational boundaries and hierarchies.

Working groups are typically initiated and staffed by people on the implementation layer of the organization. A committee is formed to advise an audience external to the committee itself, typically someone in senior leadership. Whereas the working group is open to those who consider themselves operating in the same space as the working group’s topic area, committees are selected by the entity they will be advising, and typically closed off to everyone else.

The important takeaway here is **working groups relax organizational boundaries** while **committees reinforce them**. 

| Committee | Working Group |
|-----------|---------------|
| Closed Membership | Open to all who want to contribute |
| Members are appointed | Members Volunteer (usually) |
| Findings and feedback are played back to the sponsor(s) for action and decision-making | Team decides |
| Fact finding | Action/solution bias |

## When is a working group not a working group?

When it's full of senior executives. Sometimes when a disaster has occurred, malware has penetrated your defenses, or worse, ransomeware, the senior exectives get very focused. This has the unintended effect of slowing the engineers down who are attempting to resolve the issue. 

I have, from time to time, run war rooms filled with senior executives. It was a tactic I resorted to when the organization was in such a state of panic that senior leadership members were micromanaging their teams. Software engineers can’t fix problems if they spend all their time in meetings giving their managers updates about the problems. The boot has to be moved off their necks. 

In that situation, my team would typically run two war rooms: one where the engineers were solving problems together (an actual working group) and one outfitted with lots of fancy dashboards where I was babysitting the senior executives (not an actual working group). One of the most valuable skills a leader can have is knowing when to get out of the way. 

## When do you have too many working groups?

Meetings slow down work, which almost always leads to more meetings. Some "working groups" are a just a group of people meeting on a specific topic with no real accountability or urgency. Maybe because they perceive the problem to be unsolvable at their level. 

Study the cadence, topics, and invite lists of meetings. Too often, meetings are maladapted attempts to solve problems. So if you want to know what parts of the project or organization are suffering the most, pay attention to what the team is having meetings about, how often meetings are held, and who is being dragged into those meetings. In particular, look for meetings with long invite lists. Large meetings are less effective than small meetings, but they do convincingly spread the blame around by giving everyone the impression that all parties were consulted and all opinions were explored. Meetings with ever-expanding invite lists suggest something is wrong in that area of the project.



The people in the war room of our project were a working group. The people in the war room of the failed project were a committee. 

Remember that we tend to think of failure as bad luck and success as skill. We do postmortems on failure because we’re likely to see them as complex scenarios with a variety of contributing factors. We assume that success happens for simple, straightforward reasons. In reality, success is no more or less complex than failure. You should use the same methodology to learn from success that you use to learn from failure.
