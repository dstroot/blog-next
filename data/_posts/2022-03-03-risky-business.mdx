A week never goes by when someone doesn't want to talk about technology risk. I want to share what I believe creates real risk for companies - and why internal technology risk management programs may not be working. As a CIO for over 20 years I have "seen some things" and personally wrestled with key risks outlined below. 

First, many companies address major technology risks indirectly, via a side-channel: controls. Controls are certainly important, and when the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was passed in 2002, it was a major change in the way companies handle technology controls (at least related to financial systems).

Control frameworks are a boon for consultants. I wonder how many consulting partners made their targets, for how many years, selling SOX compliance help and advice? It's easy to compare a company's processes and controls against a prescribed framework and a write a report on the results. But those same consultants never actually ran a technology organization themselves. They can tell you if your processes don't match the framework, but they can't tell you about risk. They aren't woken up in the middle of the night when a critical system fails, and they wouldn't know what the impact of the failure is on the company.

Does anyone believe that with all the new SOX controls in place that technology risk went down overall? It may have slightly, but really I didn't see it in practice. When I think of technology risk I don’t immediately think about “controls”, instead I think in terms of costs (or, how can a CIO have an even shorter career?). What are the things that I have seen personally that directly relate to risk _and manifest in significant costs_? 

## Controls indirectly reduce technology risk

Controls are part of how we think of technology “management” or “governance”. Good governance and good management are essential of course. However, control & management frameworks such as COBIT[^fn1], or service management frameworks such as ITIL[^fn2], don’t reduce risk significantly because they are focused on “management of the technology function”, not directly on reducing technology risk.  For example, COBIT’s design is based on the following principles:

* Principle 1: Meeting Stakeholder Needs
* Principle 2: Covering the Enterprise End-to-End
* Principle 3: Applying a Single Integrated Framework
* Principle 4: Enabling a Holistic Approach
* Principle 5: Separating Governance from Management
 
Do any of these principles speak directly to managing technology risk? In addition, technology controls may add to costs without getting an offsetting benefit.  Sometimes controls are ineffective, implemented poorly, or poorly designed, adding to cost and taking away from higher value work.

ITIL on the other hand does a better job addressing technology risks because a large portion is focused on service delivery, which includes reliability and availability. However, ITIL doesn't really address overall complexity in your technology environment, overall technology investment, sourcing strategy, culture, etc., which all impact technology risk. 

## What directly drives technology risk?

I am referring the things that either really impact your bottom line (and hence the stock price), or could kill your company.  Those things your cyber insurance isn't going to cover.  

* **Culture**: Companies with a strong culture of accountability and ownership experience less technology risk. [needs more content]

* **Complexity**: Imagine having a system comprised of one single component that works 99% of the time. System availability = 99%.  Now imagine the system is made up of 100 components that all work with 99% reliability. If we raise 0.99 to the hundredth power (0.99 x 0.99 x  0.99 x 0.99 …) we end up with .366, or _37% overall availability_.  Complexity is also the enemy of security. Hackers “attack the seams.” A properly managed, patched, and configured server is very difficult to attack. Professional hackers look for the seams -- the places where people and processes are not perfect and something is left exposed. The more complex your infrastructure and systems, the more likely it is to have seams with exposed vulnerabilities. Anti-complexity is the main driver of security, reliability and availability. How do we measure our complexity? Is it increasing or decreasing?

* **Change**: Not “change control” but rather the _overall amount and magnitude of change_ occurring in your technology environment in any given period.  This can be measured by the number and magnitude of projects, plus the volume of items sent through the change management process.  What is our “change vector”? Most day-to-day outages are "self inflicted wounds". One company I am familiar with let the majority of their network engineers go during a re-organization. That meant no one was making any changes to the network, and for a while it was more stable than it had ever been. Can your people cope with all the change? Have you ever heard the saying that technology changes at the speed of Moore’s law? Well, humans change at the speed of Darwin’s law. 

* **Zombie Projects**: You know what really puts an organization at risk?  The zombie projects that live in plain sight. Zombies are projects that, for any number of reasons, fail to fulfill their promise and yet keep shuffling along, sucking up resources without any real hope of having a meaningful impact on the company’s strategy or revenue prospects. Most companies reward systems carry strong penalties for failing to meet commitments, so naturally people hesitate to raise their hands and say “Our project is one of those.” It just looks smarter to find ways to stay alive. I have seen _single zombie projects cost between 10 and 40 million dollars_. If you brought in an outside, objective party to find zombies I can almost guarantee a 10x return on investment.

* **End-of-Life Technology**:  Companies are much better at introducing new technologies than retiring them. The cost of running unsupported technology is higher than you think. Costs of IT outages and data breaches run into the millions. At the end-of-life of technology, IT management has to deal with challenges such as integration issues, limited functionality, low service levels, lack of available skills, and missing support from vendors.  What is the count of systems that you retired in 2021?

* **Weak business continuity practices**: E.g. weak business engagement, design, architecture, testing …. Strong business continuity programs reduce risk in obvious ways but also in non-obvious ways.  The non-obvious ways include the need to _catalog the most critical systems_ actually are, consider what new threats exist (such as ransomware), and educate employees how to react. With on-premise, cloud, SaaS, etc. the complexity keeps increasing, along with the difficulty of validation.  With SaaS, availability is specified in a contract and is managed outside of a company’s direct control – if one of you critical systems is SaaS-based how do you really know well the vendor has addressed business continuity?

* **Sourcing**.  Sourcing can save you money (reduced labor costs), or cost you money (longer time to deliver, errors, omissions, etc.). As long as your savings and costs are all internal eventually the right balance will be achieved. However, if an error in your software _exposes your organization to liability then you must consider reputational damage as well_. Cybersecurity reputational damage has decreased because many now see it as almost outside an organization’s control, but sourcing is seen purely as a management decision. See: [Boeing's 737 Max Software Outsourced to $9-an-Hour Engineers](https://www.industryweek.com/supply-chain/article/22027840/boeings-737-max-software-outsourced-to-9anhour-engineers).

* **Adequate funding**: Organizations that do not view technology as strategic, an/or seek to minimize cost in the technology function will suffer less reliable technology. This is clear and unambiguous, the inverse is not clear unfortunately – organizations that are adequately funded can also experience less reliable technology depending on _how the money is spent_.   

* **Orphan technologies**:  We have way more systems and software titles in our organization than we have people.  That means individuals are responsible for many software titles and vendors ensuring that the software is not being managed properly, not being patched and upgraded regularly, etc.  Companies that don’t pay attention to deployed technology reaching obsolescence face a higher number of security risks and vulnerabilities than companies that keep a close eye on the life-cycle of elements in their IT landscape. Also, continuing to use hardware or software that is no longer supported makes it easier for cybercriminals to gain access to systems and data.

* **DIY/“Home Grown” infrastructure and systems driving critical business processes**:  Often, systems were built internally to scratch a specific itch decades ago and these systems gradually became part of absolutely critical business processes.  Now you have internally supported software that was not architected or designed for a critical process and often uses outdated technology and programming languages, which mean the people supporting the system no longer have market-appropriate skills and you can’t hire for those skills either. How many home systems do we have running critical business processes?

* **Black Swans**: Nearly all major outages I have seen in my career have been due to some “unique confluence of factors”. The post incident review always says something to the effect of “we never thought about or anticipated this ever occurring”. AWS "[Post-Event Summaries](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/pes/)" are fun to read because they are masterful at implying that without directly stating it. Nearly all risk management programs focus on reducing the risks we know, or have experienced before. The main thing that reduces black swans is reducing complexity.  
 
## Summary

If you want to reduce technology risk you have to be able to measure and reason about the factors that actually drive your key risks. Or, eventually those risks will manifest as costs. Then it's too late.
