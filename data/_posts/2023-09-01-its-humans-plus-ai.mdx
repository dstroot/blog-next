Despite popular opinion, AI is largely incapable of doing entire jobs (like data analyst). However, it is great at doing specific tasks within broader jobs (like data cleaning).

Take this example. In March, designers freaked out over a software called CTRHero claiming to be the “AI to replace thumbnail artists.” Reality check: the tool was mid (we can confirm).

Meanwhile, thumbnail artists who have embraced AI tools like Midjourney and Generative Fill are producing superior thumbnails way faster:

Why it matters: The lesson here is to learn how to use AI to do your job better.

This means reskilling. Executives surveyed by IBM predict that 40% of their workforce will require reskilling due to AI.

Reskilling will differ based on profession, but we recommend starting with Google Cloud’s intro AI courses and our Intro To ChatGPT course (biased but true!) and then figuring out where AI is relevant in your daily tasks.

## Reskilling Needs To Happen In Schools, Too.

As the skills required for success in the workplace evolve, so too must the skills we teach in the classroom.

Today, chools seem more preoccupied with catching AI cheaters than considering whether their teaching is even up to date. This challenge should not be downplayed - just last month, GPT-4 score a 3.57 GPA in a series of Harvard essays, aligning with the average Harvard GPA due to their renowned grade inflation!

There’s no easy answer for educators, but we think step #1 is welcoming AI in the classroom, not ignoring it.

Two Wharton Professors published 7 strategies for integrating AI into education, such as using it for feedback, explanations, and simulations.

## Being “Human-Like” Is More Important Than Ever.

LinkedIn

As AI skills grow in importance, so too are people skills.

The same LinkedIn AI report found that since ChatGPT emerged, the fastest growing in-demand skills are actually anti-AI skills…

- Flexibility (+158%).
- Professional ethics (+120%).
- Social perceptiveness (+118%).
- Self-management (83%).

…and an astonishing 92% of execs agree that people skills are more crucial now than ever before.

What this means for you: In a world where AI can handle many human tasks, excelling at what AI can't do (at least for the foreseeable future) is a tremendous advantage.

For us, that's crafting content that resonates as human-written, not AI-generated (cause it is). It's making typos in our spellng. Cracking jokes. Embracing a cat-themed brand.

This piece does a great job explaining the importance of distinguishing oneself against generative AI, using writing as an example.
