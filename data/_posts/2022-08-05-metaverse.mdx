Over the course of 2021 Meta's Reality Labs division spent $12.5 billion dollars - in a single year - building the metaverse. Why? Because the metaverse will track behavioral and biometric information at a record scale."

In 2012 an article in [New Scientist](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21628936-200-why-googles-ingress-game-is-a-data-gold-mine/) described Ingress, an AR game from Google spin-off Niantic Labs, as "a data gold mine." Ingress is a mobile app tied to the real world through GPS. In the game “exotic matter” (XM) is collected as you explore your town and allows you to take control of a “portal”. You can then link it with two other portals to create a “triangle”. Your side now “owns” that territory.

A detailed history of where all the players wander and the establishments they visit en route is collected. This location data is a data gold mine for Google, who knows who you are (you created an account to play), where you go (and when), who your friends are, etc. This was way back in 2012 - imagine the possibilities today.

Meta, arguably the worlds largest and most successful data monetization firm has gone all in. In late 2021 Facebook rebranded itself "Meta". The name change heralds the reorganization of the Facebook empire around a single concept: the metaverse. 

Over the course of 2021 Meta's Reality Labs division posted a $10.2 billion loss, earning "only" $2.3 billion after **spending $12.5 billion**. Let that sink in - Meta spent $12.5 _billion_ dollars building the metaverse in a single year. Also note the metaverse is **already** a multi-billion dollar business. 

How much of that $12.5 billion was spent on your privacy? Today "experiences" in the metaverse already replace advertising, by letting users wear virtual clothes or test drive virtual cars. All the data – who wore what, who saw what, who drove what, and for how long – is recorded and will be shared/sold by default.

To give you a sense of how valuable your data is to Meta, Apple’s decision to enable iPhone users to turn off tracking has reduced Meta’s ability to profit from you:

* Revenue is down for the second consecutive quarter; quarterly profits likewise. Previously Meta never had a down quarter.
* Meta’s market cap dropped from $1.1tn to $450bn in 10 months.

In addition, there is increasing interest from regulators and governments in Meta’s business practices due to the persistent smell given off by Meta’s problems with privacy, toxic content and misinformation. 

As a reminder, in 2019 Meta was fined a historic [$5 billion dollars for privacy violations](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2019/07/ftc-imposes-5-billion-penalty-sweeping-new-privacy-restrictions-facebook) in relation to the [Cambridge Analytica scandal](/posts/2018-03-16-facebook-suspends-cambridge-analytica). The $5 billion penalty against Meta was the largest ever imposed on any company for violating consumers’ privacy and almost **20 times greater than the largest privacy or data security penalty ever imposed worldwide**. It is one of the largest penalties ever assessed by the U.S. government for any violation. Yet that figure is **less than half of what Meta is willing to spend in a single year building the metaverse**.

Is Meta's metaverse a place where you will be safe, secure and private? Or, will Meta be collecting all the data it can and correlating that data with everything else they know about you and selling it to anyone who is willing to pay? 

The potential data they can collect using VR: 

- **Geospatial Telemetry** (Height, Arm Length, Interpupillary Distance, and Room Dimensions); 
- **Device Identification** (Refresh Rate, Tracking Rate, Resolution, Device Field-of-View, GPU, and CPU); 
- **Network** (Bandwidth, Proximity); 
- **Behavioral Observations** (Languages, Handedness, Voice, Reaction Time, Close Vision, Distance Vision, Color Vision, Cognitive Acuity, and Fitness).

From these metrics, various inferences can be made about a VR participant's gender, sexual orientation, wealth, ethnicity, age, and disabilities. In addition, from the data collected about you in the virtual world it will be highly likely Meta will able to identify who you are in the real, physical world. That seems ironic as most people today have the impression that in virtual reality they will be free to "be whatever and whoever" they wish, separate from their real identities.  

Privacy is only one of the many issues in the metaverse. Online harassment, trolling, and toxic behavior has been a problem on the Internet since modems and bulletin boards. With new levels of realism and interaction in the metaverse, new controls and limits are required. Meta has implemented a a "Personal Boundary" for avatars in its Horizon Worlds and Horizon Venues. Avatars are limited in how closely they can interact to prevent virtual molestation.

>"Personal Boundary prevents avatars from coming within a set distance of each other, creating more personal space for people and making it easier to avoid unwanted interactions..."

><cite>&mdash; Vivek Sharma, VP of Meta's Horizon group</cite>

Personal Boundaries prevent other avatars from invading your avatar's personal space, without any haptic feedback to simulate a collision. Additional anti-harassment measures, such as having an avatar’s hands "disappear" if they encroach upon someone’s personal space, have been implemented. What else will be needed?

The time is now to start a dialog on the challenges of privacy and security in the metaverse. What data will you be able to ask Meta not to collect? How will Meta deal with new trust and safety challenges, such as the abuse of virtual avatars and the safety of virtual assets? Some people even wonder what legal system (if any) applies to the metaverse. 

Meta will need to implement privacy options and risk mitigation policies to make the metaverse a private and safe space for users. Do you trust them to so?
