The wealth of information available through augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) hardware and software has been known for years. For example, a 2012 article in [New Scientist](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21628936-200-why-googles-ingress-game-is-a-data-gold-mine/) described Ingress, an AR game from Google spin-off Niantic Labs, as "a data gold mine." 

Ingress is a mobile app tied to the real world through GPS. “Exotic matter” (XM) is collected as you explore your town and allows you to take control of a "portal". You can then link it with two other portals to create a triangle. Your side now “owns” that territory.

As they play the game a detailed record of where all the Ingress players wander – and the establishments they visit en route – is being collected. This location data is a data gold mine for Google - who will know who you are (you created an account to play), where you travel and when, and who your friends are (and where they travel), etc.

Meta, arguably the worlds largest and most successful data monetization firm has gone all in. In late 2021 Facebook rebranded itself "Meta". The name change heralds the reorganization of the Facebook empire around a single concept: the metaverse. 

Over the course of 2021 Meta's Reality Labs division posted a $10.2 billion loss, earning only $2.3 billion after **spending $12.5 billion**. Let that sink in - Meta spent $12.5 billion dollars building the metaverse in a single year. Also note the metaverse is **already** a multi-billion dollar business. 

How much of that $12.5 billion was spent on your privacy? Not much. 



While the metaverse is still at a nascent stage, it is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years, opening new possibilities for enterprises in terms of trade in digital assets, customer experience, and employee skilling. However, as the metaverse expands, enterprises will have to deal with new Trust and Safety (T&S) challenges, such as the abuse of virtual avatars and the safety of virtual assets. They will need to come up with risk mitigation policies to make the metaverse a safe space for users.

"Advanced technologies, especially in VR headsets and smart glasses, will track behavioral and biometric information at a record scale," explains The Everest Group in its recent report: "Taming the Hydra: Trust and Safety in the Metaverse".

"At present, digital technologies can capture data regarding facial expressions, hand movements, and gestures. Hence, personal, and sensitive information that will leak through the metaverse in the future will include real-world information about user habits and physiological characteristics."

The potential data points identified by the researchers include: 

- Geospatial Telemetry (Height, Arm Length, Interpupillary Distance, and Room Dimensions); 
- Device Specifications (Refresh Rate, Tracking Rate, Resolution, Device Field-of-View, GPU, and CPU); 
- Network (Bandwidth, Proximity); 
- Behavioral Observations (Languages, Handedness, Voice, Reaction Time, Close Vision, Distance Vision, Color Vision, Cognitive Acuity, and Fitness).

From these metrics, various inferences can be made about a VR participant's gender, wealth, ethnicity, age, and disabilities. In addition, from the data collected about you in the virtual world it will be highly likely Meta will able to identify you in the real, physical world. In a very simple example if you upload a picture of your face for your avatar, I can match that to data collected by cameras at your local shopping mall via facial recognition. However Meta will have data on you far beyond this simple example.
