<CodeBlock>

```JavaScript:cn.ts
export function cn(...classes: string[]) {
  return classes.filter(Boolean).join(" ");
}
```

</CodeBlock>

### Context

There is a highly used NPM package called [classnames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames) - however I like to keep external dependencies low where possible and I like to know what my code is doing. There is no need to import classnames as you can duplicate the code with the simple function above. 

#### What does .filter(Boolean) do on Arrays?

In short, it's a bit of functional programming which is used to remove false, null and undefined values from an array.

### Usage

<CodeBlock>

```JavaScript:cnExample.tsx
import { cn } from "../lib/cn";

export const Navbar = ({ fixed }: { fixed: boolean }) => {
  return (
    <nav className={cn("bg-white", fixed ? "fixed top-0 left-0 right-0" : "")}>
      Item
    </nav>
  );
};
```

</CodeBlock>
