<CodeBlock>

```JavaScript:timeout.ts
export function timeout(delay: number) {
    return new Promise( res => setTimeout(res, delay) );
}
```

</CodeBlock>

### Context

Sometimes when you are building something you want to see how it works with a little delay. I use this for playing with, or testing, React suspense. 

### Usage

<CodeBlock>

```JavaScript:waitExample.ts
import { timeout } from "../lib/timeout";

await timeout(1000); //for 1 sec delay
```

</CodeBlock>
