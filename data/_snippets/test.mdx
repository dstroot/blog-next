title: Test Title Which is REALLY Long Because it Keeps Going
summary: You are contributing value, whether you like it not, when you make your
  code public. Training machine learning models on publicly available data is
  considered fair use across the machine learning community. The models gain
  insight and accuracy from the public collective intelligence. The only way to
  extract value back out is to use Copilot yourself.

## Test Title

This page tests out several rendering functions

### Test title with some regular markdown

[GitHub](https://github.com/) (owned by [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/)), has partnered with [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) to create an AI tool called [Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/) that **writes code for you**. It is a plugin to [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which auto-generates code based on the contents of the current file, and your current cursor location.

Open AI developed [Codex](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03374), a deep neural network language model that translates natural language into code, and Codex is integrated with Copilot. Side note: _OpenAI runs on Microsoft Azure_.

OpenAI's Codex was trained on publicly available source code and natural language, so it understands **both programming and human languages**. Codex is an API-driven service that has many more capabilities, which developers can explore — and build into their own apps — when OpenAI opens access to Codex later this year (2021).

| 1. Evidence must be presented to support decisions made. (1) (R)                               | 0.79 |     |     |
| 2. People often make assertions that they cannot support. (1)                                  | 0.61 |     |     |
| 3. It is easy to get access to the data I need to make good decisions. (1) (R)                 | 0.62 |     |     |
| 4. When making decisions we place more emphasis on evidence than on personal opinions. (1) (R) | 0.79 |     |     |
