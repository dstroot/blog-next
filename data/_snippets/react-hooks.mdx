There are many React hooks I find very useful and rather than documenting the ones I frequently use I thought it's easier (and better) to just provide some links here to some great collections and hooks I use frequently.

## React Hooks I often Use

- useBoolean
- useToggle
- useHasMounted
- useIntersectionObserver
- useHookForm
